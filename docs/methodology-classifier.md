# Classification Methodology

The classifier blends two signals:

1. Structural prototype similarity (ingredient & instruction token overlap with curated archetypes)
2. Lexical / NLP keyword presence (stemmed culinary domain lexicon)

An arbitration layer resolves conflicts; tie-breaking favors higher structural confidence.

Outputs feed ranking & downstream analysis.
